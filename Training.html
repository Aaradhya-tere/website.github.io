<font size = "4"> Training your dog has numerous benefits. It provides mental stimulation which is an important part of keeping dogs healthy. Teaching them important commands makes them more manageable in public, allows them to acknowledge that you are the master, and if you go beyond the basics, impress your guests with some well timed tricks. There are two main types of dog training that are listed below. I strongly recommend the positive reinforcement method, but negative reinforcement has its place and has been used traditionally for all kinds of animals. <br> <br>
<b> Positive Reinforcement </b> <br>
Positive reinfocement is a method in which something is added to an experience. This "something" can be pleasant or unpleasant. For example, a trainer might sternly say "No" when a dog does something undesirable. Although the "no" is negative for the dog, something is being added to the experience, so it is an example of positive reinforcement. Another example is giving a dog treats when it masters a behaviour. This is adding a positive experience for the dog, so it is also positive reinofcement. This is also an example of reward based training, which is explained below. Positive reinforcement is widely advocated and is commonly used. <br>
<b> Reward Based Training </b> <br>
In positive reinforcement, this particular type of training is very popular with current dog owners. In this, any bad behaviours are simply ignored, and favourable behaviours are reinforced with a treat or happy tone of voice. Generally, dogs tend to stop doing behaviours that receive no attention, so it is likely that your dog's bad habits will simply cease if you ignore them. The reaosn for this is that dogs only associate reprimands with the current moment. An example of this is if you left your dog alone for a couple of hours and it peed on the rug. If you reprimand it when you get home, it will not know what you are reprimanding it for, and that may create negative associations with you. This also goes for positive feedback. If a dog has been lying down while resting, and you give it a treat, it believes you are rewarding it for resting. <br>
<b> Negative Reinforcement </b> <br>
This is a now controversial way of dog training, but it has its advantages and was used for thousands of years. In this type of training, something is taken away to cause a behaviour to occur more frequently. For example, a shock collar is applied, but it turns off as soon as the dog sits. This teaches the dog to sit quickly to stop the pain. This is not a very humane technique, but it can be useful as the first step for dehabilitating aggressive dogs. <br>
<b> Important Commands </b> Below are a list of essential commands that will make your dog more manageable around other people and other dogs. 
<ol>
<li> <b> Sit </b></li> This command is very simple to learn, and is useful in a situation when you don't want your dog to move, or make your dog more manageable.
<li> <b> Down </b> </li> This command is useful to teach your dog to control his impulses and avoid distractions. 
<li> <b> Stay </b> </li> This is unbelieavbly useful, as you can leave your dog outside a store while you quickly grab something. 
<li> <b> Heel </b> </li> It teaches your dog to walk by your side and not lunge ahead on walks. 
<li> <b> Come </b> </li> It can be used to extract your dog from a potentially dangerous situation, or recall it on leash free walks.  
</ol>
