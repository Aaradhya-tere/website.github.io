<font size = "4"> Choosing a dog is a daunting task. Your decision will, with any luck, be with you for 10 years. This dog will be in your house for the next ten years and inlfuence your experiences. This is a big decision to make, and this article will help you feel more confident in your choice.

<li> <b> Choose A Dog Breed </b> </li>
You need to choose a dog breed that fits your lifestyle. One very important disclaimer is that there is a massive range of energy levels even between dogs of the same breed. You need to assess the personality of the dog, but their breed will give you a decent indicator. You need to consider your activeness and energy levels, the time you have to invest in your pet, your previous experience with owning dogs, and many other factors. Often, dog owners make the mistake of choosing a breed that is too active for them. This causes the dogs to release their pent up energy in an aggresive or destructive manner, and the dog is then relinquished to the shelter. Barely any dogs in the shelter are actually mentally unstable, so if you aren't concerned about breed, buy a dog from a shelter. You'll save its life, and get an amazing price. However, if you are concerned about breed, consider energy levels carefully. A Siberian husky for a sedentary family is sure to be a bad choice, as is a Maltese for an active family. As seen below, some large breeds like greyhounds can have generally low energy levels, while huskies live up to their reputation. <br>

<li> <b> Choose a Breeder </b> </li> 
Choose a reputable breeder. Make sure you don't choose a complete rookie breeder, but also definitely avoid the breeders that churn out dogs at a rate similar to a car factory. Don't buy any dogs from big organisations, as these dogs often have mulitgenerational inbreeding problems. Choose a backyard breeder that is experienced and knowledgable. Check all the breeding certificates for your dog, and make sure no inbreeding has occurred. Once you have chosen a breeder, it is time to choose which particular pup you will be taking home. <br> <br>
<li> <b> Final Choice </b> </li> 
You're at the breeders house. The paperwork is in order. Now, it's time to meet BOTH the parents of the litter. You can learn a lot about a litter including their personality simply by meeting their parents. If the breeder is relcuctant to show you both the parents, go back a step and find another breeder. Assuming that the dogs are amazing parents, it is now time to choose the particular pup. While gender does not play a huge role once the dog is neutered, keep in mind that if you are not going neuteur your male dog, he  is likely to be more aggresive and be more excitable. Keeping that in mind, choose your puppies. A simple test that has withstood the trial of time is to shake the pen and see which puppies are confident and approach you. This puppy is likely to grow into a strong, confident loving companion, although the way you treat it will be the major influencer. Don't choose a puppy based solely on colour. Be wary if a breeder offers you a discount on a particular puppy, but if the two of you hit it off well, you can buy it. Don't spend too long pondering your choice, and go for it!<br> <br>
<li> <b> Being Comfortable with your Decision </b> </li>  

While you can sometimes have doubts about whether you have chosen the right pup when your pup acts up, remember that the way you raise your pup will be the fundamental factor in determining their adult personality. Good care and discipline can turn any dog around. There is no bad dog, only a bad owner. So be confident in your choice. The question is not if you have chosen the right pup, but if the pup has chosen the right master! <br> </ol>
