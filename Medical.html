<font size = "4"> As we are not veterinarians, no advice here is to be followed without consulting your veterinarian. This article will mainly be concerned with basic medical needs of dogs, and how to pick the right vet. <br> 
<strong> Picking A Vet </strong> <br>
Picking up the right veterinary doctor for your dog can save you a small fortune, and more importantly, ensure the best health for your pet. The best advice I can offer off the bat is to not stick with the first vet you consult, but instead to keep consulting different vets until you find one that matches your and your dog's needs. Your vet needs to be calm, assured and knowledgable. <br> 
<strong> Puppy Vaccinations </strong> <br>
There are many vaccinations your puppy needs to get done before it can experience the world. Before then, it is dangerous for it to be in public, and possibly life threatening. Below are the various vaccines and when you need to get them done. <br>

<b> Breed Related Medical Problems </b> <br>
Unfortunately, as a result of selective breeding, many dog breeds have severe health problems. Humans bred these dogs to have "cute" and desirable traits without acknowledging the health risk these features caused. The problem is accentuated by factory like dog breeders that may unknowingly indulge in multigenerational inbreeding. This is only a problem with pure breed dogs, so if you want to avoid these, rescue a dog from the shelter. For more information on that, click <a href = "https://www.rspcansw.org.au/adopt/"> here </a>. However, many pure breeds have common medical problems. Take that into consideration when buying a dog. Since there are so many health defects, go to <a href = "https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/ss/slideshow-dog-breed-health-problems"> this </a> website to find about all of them.
