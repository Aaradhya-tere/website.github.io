<td> German Shepherd </td>
<td> 50 000 </td>
<td> The German Shepherd rocketed to fame in America after a series of film featuring a well trained heroic dog actor called Rin Tin Tin. For a long time, it was the most popular breed in America until the Labrador's. They are exemplary dogs, and are used heavily by the armed forces and police departments. They are known for their stunning work ethic, and their discipline and obedience. They are most ideally suited to households without children. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Retriever (Golden) </td>
<td> 45 000 </td>
<td> They are often confused with Labrador's but they are two very distinct breeds. The Labrador Retriever is perfect for someone that wants an affectionate dog without the boundless energy of other breeds. The golden retriever settles well into households with small children, and is a very affectionate breed. They are known to "enjoy life" and are content to follow their owners. </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> French Bulldog </td>
<td> Not released </td>
<td> The French Bulldog has shot up from 76th to fourth in 20 years. This is due to a range of factors, including media exposure, and a demand for a friendly, relaxed dog that does well in cramped urban areas. French Bulldogs are amazing around children, and don't need regular exercise like the other breeds do. As mentioned, they do very well in apartments, and can be relied on to stay calm if they miss their walks. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Bulldog </td>
<td> Not released </td>
<td> The bulldog's thick set, low slung, well muscled body and face have become the symbol of courage and stolidity. Bulldogs exhibit these characteristics when needed, but are normally fun, adaptable dogs. They are docile, loyal companions. Bulldogs are amazing lapdogs, but need their walks and a careful diet to stay in good shape. Because of their short snout, hot days are best spent inside as it makes it difficuclt for them to breathe. </td>
